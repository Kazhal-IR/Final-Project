    GDPR stands for” General Data Protection Regulation”. This law was set and applied in all of the EU member countries since 2018. GDPR is aiming to achieve many goals that I’m about to mention. The main reason for GDPR is basically to provide individuals with greater protections and juridical rights, by charging the rule breaker companies and individuals by extremely huge fines as well as reputational damage. There are 6 important principals in this established rule 
    1.	Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency
    This principal tries to publish the need for keeping the data of users lawfully, fairly, and transparently. This means that for full filling the criteria of lawfulness, whatever activity that you are doing must be correct according to the related laws to the lawfulness in GDPR. The criteria of fairness says that you must use the personal data exactly in the way that you have informed your costumers, and for full filling the criteria of transparency you should clearly explain your intentions of using costumers data, as well as the way that it will be performed. 
    2.	Purpose Limitation
    This principal gently points at the fact that there must be a legitimate reason behind any usage of data. In this way you can’t ask for any sort of data, if there is no good reason behind it. 
    3.	Data minimization
    This principal plays an adjacent role with the previous principal. In other words, this one complements the last one. What this rule wants to say is that the personal data should only be collected when there is a reasonable business function going on. In any other cases usage of costumer’s data is not allowed. 
    4.	Accuracy
    All of the personal data which is collected from people must be kept in a safe place with high rates of security. 
    5.	Storage limitations
    The data collected must have an expire date. What that means is that no company or website is allowed to keep the costumer’s data after the time that they need, or the time that they have initially stated. 
    
    
    
    6.	Integrity and confidentiality
    The integrity and confidentiality of the personal data must be kept, which also means that the information must be encrypted by high level technological machines so that if the information fall in wrong hands in the worst case scenario, no taking advantages of personal info appears.
    
    All of the mentioned principals are a requirement to maintain our safety in our nowadays life. In the world that we are living in, almost anything is highly related to technology, and that itself increases the risk of being wrongly treated or even abused. Transparent enough, GDPR gives us the opportunity to continue safely surf online, in any circumstances. GDPR also increases the consumer confidence, because when people are fully assured that they aren’t going to be a target to be taken advantage of, they can rely more on online surfing and consequently, online shopping, ordering, visiting etc. This can increase the economic currency circulation and lead to an economical sustainable development. 
    
    One disadvantage with GDPR that I can point out is the extremely high rates of financial penalties that companies need to pay, in case of trespassing the guidelines of GDPR. For instance, H&M company was accused for breaking a GDPR rule in relation to employment practices which eventually left this company with a financial bill worth 35.3 million euros. 
    
    On the other hand, this amount of money is extremely huge, and that itself, reduces the possible audacity and freedom that companies, as well as websites, would potentially like to have to use our information to their own benefit. Furthermore, these extremely tough redlines are absolutely important to keep an eye on sources that have access to our important personalized data. That’s great! Because otherwise, the internet hackers and companies would’ve defiantly found a sidewalk to trick us and use our information to their own benefits, without us even realizing anything about their actions. But by seeing an obligatory rule called GDPR which subsequently limits these sources, we can calmly put our heads on our pillows with less concerns about being informationally abused.

        copyright
Copyright is a right that protects creator’s creation’s value. In other words, this law gives a right to the creator to keep the value of their work, which could be any thing such as poems, novels, musical work, computer software etc. Without this law, people could freely download, publish, re-use, re-touch and even sell someone else’s work in the black market, but even widely on internet or anywhere else. In this way, the original producer couldn’t get the credit (societal like attention and economical like money) of their work. And I think that’s quite trivial that the less feedback (societal and economical) the artist or the creator gets, the less engagement and work will get done by them, which consequentially will tighten the circle of aesthetics and creativity worldwide. Therefore, we can say that Copyright is there to protect the creators. For example, one of the good things with this law is that when you copyright your works as a creator, you will have the ownership of your work and your name will be spread all across the world, in addition to the fact that your artwork will be protected from any sort of copyright violations (if not, you will be able to send people violating copyright to the court)
To clarify more, the copyright lasts for the life of the creator plus an extra 70 years which is a great bit of time. Some of the functions of this law are for instance that the creator has the full ownership to their creation. This follows the fact that no one will later be able to distribute, sell, publicly display, or perform the work, without permission of the copyright owner (also the creator). If by any chance, there were some people who wanted any of the mentioned things to take action, they can demand for buying the right /license of the product/creation from the creator. This law has also a heavy redline penalty, so incase of violating the copyright of any publisher, you will be in charge of paying a fine ranged between 200-150000 US Dollars.
For example, in year 2009 Guess was sued by Gucci because of infringing 5 of their trademarks and in the and Guess was up to paying 4.7 million US Dollars.

        The “LEK” stands for “Law of Electronic Kommunication”. The provisions of the law are basically designed to make sure that individuals, as well as the authorities can obtain safe and effective electronic communications, as well as having the ability to the greatest extend possible in the selection of electronic communications services and their price and quality. The plan that the Swedish Riksdag has for aiming this goal is to set up a competitive system for the internet field with an affordable price.
Following to the fact that a significant number of Swedish people have the availability to access internet, worldwide, some sort of issues such as ciber abusements might as well accure. Cookies are for example something that can potentially be misused. Cookies by definition are small text files that the website that you are visiting asks you to be saved on your computer, mobile phone or any other platform that you are applying from. They are really good because it gives you the opportunity to track how other users browse. Here comes the LEK law and takes action. According to the Law of Electronic Communication, every individual who visits a site with cookies should approach the data that the site contains, as well as the purpose of using these cookies. On the ither hand, all of the users must give their permission of using the cookies, otherwise the usage of these data will be forbidden. There are ofcourse some exceptions to this law as well. For example, in some special cases cookies are expected to send an electronic message through an electronic correspondence’s organization, or when the handling is extremely necessary to provide the service of cookies to the user, whom had already explicitly requested for the service.
